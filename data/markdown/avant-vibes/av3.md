The Avant Vibes webpage took two design cues from seemingly disparate design philosophies. The general layout and arguably main theme of the site was minimalism, as utilised by retail sites such as Supreme.

Here the web designer has opted for a simple, high contrast colour scheme of black, white and red as well as saturated monochrome background photo. This makes the site highly readable, and when paired with the simple layout of the site it draws the viewer’s attention to the text content or photo content of the products. One could also draw the connection to this style of design to the physical retail location’s layout schema, opting for a simple uncrowded space where the products themselves are emphasized by the surronding negative spaces.
